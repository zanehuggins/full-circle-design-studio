<h1 class="col-12 float-left">DESIGNING A TYPEFACE</h1>
<p class="col-12">

  Overlap is a display typeface designed for headers and occasionally sub- headers, and large-scale poster designs. It is available in two different color schemes specifically for Morgantown Pride:
  Warm/Cool

  Technical Skills Learned
</h5>
<p class="col-12 float-left">
  As a graphic designer who is very enthusiastic about typography and type design, I had previous experience building typefaces using Fontstruct in our advanced typography course, and then with Glyphs Mini, which I had used to develop a typeface for other projects that I have been involved in. This application has great tools for building fonts, and I always rec- comend them to anyone who is interested in pursuing type design. The version I had, however, did not have the full advanced functionality that would be required to build a multi-layer color font that I had designed.
  The typeface took its first digital form in Illustrator, as you can copy and paste the vector shapes into Glyphs from there. I do this as it allows me to work in a familiar interface when trying to reach quick deadlines.
  After obtaining a copy of the advanced Glyphs application, which allowed me to work with multiple layers, with was required to build a functioning copy of the typeface, I had to do a lot of online research on how to edit shapes in these layers, and make sure that the kerning lined up perfectly for each glyph between layers so that the letters didn’t appear fragmented. After figuring out how to do this correctly, the next obstacle was the most frustrating: exporting the font into an open typeface file that could be supported by most computers and web browsers. This part of the process took several days, as there are many “Instances” and functions that you have to set. It almost reminded me of creating functions for PHP code,
  The following is an example of how Overlap is should be used:

  as I was trying to get certain sections of data to communicate with each other to export the proper information. I have actualy printed a huge user manual with many great tutorials from Glyphs website that i referenced throughout the process and I look forward to sitting down and reading it in the near future so I can become as fluent in this software as I am in most of the Adobe applications.

  <h5 class="col-12 float-left">Conclusion</h5>
  <p class="col-12 float-left">
  It would have been easy to design a pamphlet on something that I al- ready knew and used the Gilbert typeface with similar visual elements as the one that I have designed, but the curves and colors of that typeface were not fully consistent with Morgantown Pride’s color palette and visual language. I wanted to design something that truly captured the essence of their message and paired seemlessly with the content and images. As for the gender spectrum pamphlet, it was a huge struggle, and I searched high and low for meaningful content. This was not the easy route to take, but I chose to persure it because it expanded my knowledge on both the content and the skills required to provide it.
  Finally, the ultimate reason for making the typeface into a functioning typeface that can be used on most any platform was because it gave our client ownership of the design. They can now use it freely whenever they find it is useful! That is the whole idea of ownership; what good would it have done if only the designers could buuld words out of the vector letters in Adobe software? This is a point made in our Design for Social Change book by Andrew Shea. Now Morgantown Pride can use this design to create designs of their own, and when used in accordance to the branding guide’s rules, they can make truly great pieces that can make an impact in their campaigns and endeavors.
